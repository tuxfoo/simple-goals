# simple-goals

A goal overlay bundle for nodecg with a rest API.
On its own, this goal overlay is just responsible for rendering and configuring the appearance of a goal overlay. You will need to create a connector for which ever streaming/donation service you are using.

The goal can work with anything that can be counted(follower's, tips, etc).

Currently there is a connector for the following streaming services.
